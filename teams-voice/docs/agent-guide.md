## What Callers Hear

When someone calls, they hear:

> "Thanks for calling A. C. T. O. Press 1 for Sales, Press 2 for Support, or say the name of the person you are trying to reach."

- **Press 1 or say "Sales"** → Sales Queue
- **Press 2 or say "Support"** → Support Queue
- **Say your name** → Routes directly to you (e.g., "Eric", "Quentin", "Sue")

## How Call Routing Works

Calls ring each person for **15 seconds** before moving to the next:

### Sales Queue
1. Quentin (15 seconds)
2. Eric (15 seconds)
3. Sue (15 seconds)
4. → Voicemail (after 45 seconds total)

### Support Queue
1. Eric (15 seconds)
2. Quentin (15 seconds)
3. Sue (15 seconds)
4. → Voicemail (after 45 seconds total)

**Your Teams status matters!** Presence-based routing is enabled on both queues. This means calls will **only ring you when your status is Available**. Any other status — Away, Busy, In a call, Do Not Disturb, Offline, Be Right Back, or Out of Office — causes the queue to silently skip you and ring the next person.

This is **not configurable per-status** (e.g., you can't allow Away but block DND). It's all or nothing: Available = calls ring, anything else = calls skip.

**What this means in practice:**
- Set yourself to **Available** when you're ready to take calls
- If you step away briefly, calls will skip to the next agent — this is by design
- If you're on a call, the queue will also skip you (but you won't get a busy signal since BusyOnBusy is disabled)
- If no agents are Available, calls go to voicemail after the timeout

## Answering Calls

When a call comes in:
1. Your **Teams app will ring** (desktop, mobile, or both)
2. You'll see the caller ID (if available)
3. Click/tap **Answer** to take the call

If you miss it, it automatically moves to the next person in the queue.

---

## Voicemail

If no one answers after 45 seconds, the call goes to **Eric's Teams voicemail**.

To check voicemail:
1. Open Teams
2. Go to **Calls** (left sidebar)
3. Click **Voicemail**

## After Hours

Outside business hours, calls forward directly to Eric's cell phone.

## Tips

- **Keep Teams running** on your computer or phone so you don't miss calls
- **Mobile app**: Install Microsoft Teams on your phone for calls on the go
- **Transferring calls**: While on a call, click **...** → **Transfer** → choose a person
- **Putting calls on hold**: Click the **Hold** button during a call
